To write a sonnet doth Juana press me,
I've never found me in such stress or pain;
A sonnet numbers fourteen lines, 'tis plain, 
And three are gone, ere I can say, God bless me!

I thought that spinning rhymes might sore oppress me,
Yet here I'm midway in the last quatrain;
And if the foremost tercet I can gain,
The quatrains need not any more distress me.

To the first tercet I have got at last
And travel through it with such right good will, 
That with this line I've finished it, I ween;

I'm in the second now, and see how fast 
The thirteenth line runs tripping from my quill;
Hurrah, 'tis done! Count if there be fourteen!
