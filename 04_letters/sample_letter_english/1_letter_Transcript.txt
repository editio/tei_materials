Dear John,
How's life treating you? I've been enjoying my time in Spain, where I've had the pleasure of exploring the picturesque streets of Barcelona and indulging in delectable tapas in Madrid. Soon, I will be embarking on a journey to Italy, where I look forward to savoring authentic pasta in Rome, appreciating the magnificent art in Florence, and immersing myself in the rich culture that this country has to offer. I truly wish you were here to share in these incredible experiences.
Wishing you all the best,
Tomek
